libdrawp
==========

libdraw port (from Plan 9).

This port includes unix versions of Plan 9's libdraw, libmemdraw and
libmemlayer.

To regenerate  the library files from Plan 9 source, use the 'autogen' make
target and set 'plan9' to the root of the Plan 9 system. For example:

	make autogen plan9=$HOME/sysfromiso

This will overwrite the current files, so use with caution.

To compile:

	make
